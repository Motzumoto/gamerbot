# GamerBot
Welcome to GamerBot, a Discord bot for Gaming event management as well as gaming statistics.

GamerBot comes with a variety of commands for admins or game-night managers. Members can be muted, moved, etc in voice channels and there are many pre-built commands for moving around players in voice channels. It also comes with a setup command to setup your server ready for game nights in seconds!

GamerBot also uses APIs to provide live statistics for numerous games. 

GamerBot also comes with many other useful commands, such as polling and nick-naming, so I suggest adding it to your server and trying it out! 

The code is fully public in this repository for you to see how all the commands work.
